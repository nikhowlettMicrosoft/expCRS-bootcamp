      <h2>Intro to WebJobs</h2>

      WebJobs are lightweight apps that offer standalone event-driven experience, similar to a server in a Pub-Sub system. 
      These are responsible for some of the services that Consumption ExP owns. 
      <ul>
        <li>Development with WebJobs means interfacing with Azure components like </li>
        <li>Blob, Queues, Tables, Service Bus, "a snap!"</li>
      </ul>
      In this coding bootcamp you will develop your own WebJob and build it locally to test it out. <br />
      Make sure that you are familiar with how to build an WebJob locally and what the basic structure of a WebJob looks like
      by looking at the documentation below and by taking a few minutes to look through the main files in the provided repo.
