        Steps to send data to our Web Jobs
        <ol>
          <li>
            First we will need a Visual Studio Solution to fire scorecard events.
            The repo is linked below.
            
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>Once you have opened the solution, </li>
            <li>Make sure the client is connecting to the same topic as in your web job. </li>
            <li>The setting for the Event solution is in Program.cs in the FireEventsForScorecardList function.</li>
            <li>The location for the topic name for the Web Job may vary between web jobs, but usually can be found in App.config </li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>Additionally, </li>
            <li>Make sure the client is connecting to the same service bus as in your web job. </li>
            <li>The setting for the Event solution is in Program.cs in the Constants.cs</li>
            <li>The location for the Service Bus connection for the Web Job can usually can be found in App.config </li>
          </ul>
          <li>
            Add a breakpoint in the *MessageHandler.cs file for the Web Job and run the specified Web Job. 
          </li>
          <li></li>
          <li>With the Job running and breakpoint set,</li>
          <li>Run the 'FireScorecardEvents' Solution.</li>
          <li>If the breakpoint is hit, Congratulations, we have successfully received data!</li>
