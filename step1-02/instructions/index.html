      <h2>Build a Web Job Locally</h2>
      <div>
        First download the Consumption Web Jobs repo linked below.
        <br />
        After downloading the repo linked below, we will need to chose a WebJob. 
        <br />
        Open the solution file found in the src directory.
        <br />
        In the visual studio solution explorer, 
        investigate each web Job and find one that contains a file called 
        'AzureSubscriptionMessageHandler'. 
        <br />
        This file ensures that we will be 
        sending & receiving data with this Web Job so that we can test your setup
        in the upcoming steps. 
        <br />
        After chosing a WebJob, paste the 'exe.config' 
        file 
        from the last step
        into app.config
        <br />
        This step provides the WebJob 
        with the required connection strings 
        to connect to the Azure resources like the 
        Queues, Blobs, ServiceBus, and more. 
        
        <br />
        Now,
        build the solution.
        </ul>
