      <h2>Build a Web Job Locally</h2>
      <div>
        <ul>
        <li>First download the Consumption Web Jobs repo linked below.</li>
        <br />
        After downloading the repo linked below, we will need to chose a WebJob. 
        <br />
        <li> Open the solution file found in the src directory. </li>
        <br />
        <li>In the visual studio solution explorer, 
        investigate each web Job and find one that contains a file called 
        'AzureSubscriptionMessageHandler'. </li> 
        <br />
        This file ensures that we will be 
        sending & receiving data with this Web Job so that we can test your setup
        in the upcoming steps.
      </ul> 
        <br />
        <ul>
        <li>After chosing a WebJob, paste the 'exe.config' 
        file 
        from the last step
        into app.config</li>
        <br />
        This step provides the WebJob 
        with the required connection strings 
        to connect to the Azure resources like the 
        Queues, Blobs, ServiceBus, and more. 
      
        <br />
        Now,
        build the solution.
        </ul>
      </div>
    </section>
    <section>
      In the upcoming steps we will test out the WebJob by sending and receiving data. 
      For now take a look through its contents.
        <br />
        <h3>A Web Job's surface level actions can be viewed in Program.cs</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>From this file you can tell</li> 
          <ul>
            <li>Which configurations are used and set</li>
            <li>Which services and files will be used</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>

        <ul>
          <li>WebJobNameDirectory/</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Program.cs </li>
            <li>App.config - Contains Connection Strings & other Settings</li>
            <li>UnityConfig.cs - Instantiates common elements like DataStore(s) and HtmlClient(s)</li>
            <li>*MessageHandler.cs - Contains logic to handle Service Bus Messages</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
